# Analysis Report

## Alignment Statistics
Reports alignment summary statistics for CRAM files. Key metrics include total reads, mapped reads, duplicates, and properly paired reads. These statistics provide insights into sequencing quality and alignment efficiency.

### Sample: NA12878_Statistics
- **320072124 + 0 mapped (95.42%**: N/A)
- **294504093 + 0 primary mapped (95.05%**: N/A)
- **287217566 + 0 properly paired (92.70%**: N/A)
- **3939296 + 0 singletons (1.27%**: N/A)

### Sample: NA06994_Statistics
- **109338882 + 0 mapped (99.86%**: N/A)
- **99339182 + 0 primary mapped (99.84%**: N/A)
- **96020806 + 0 properly paired (96.51%**: N/A)
- **141032 + 0 singletons (0.14%**: N/A)

## Sex Inference Based on Coverage
This section provides an analysis of sex inference based on genomic coverage data. The results are derived from coverage patterns across sex chromosomes, enabling the determination of the likely biological sex for each sample.

### Sample: NA12878_Sex_Inference
```female
```

**Interpretation**: The sample is likely biologically **Female**.

### Sample: NA06994_Sex_Inference
```male
```

**Interpretation**: The sample is likely biologically **Male**.

## Genome Coverage
This section provides an analysis of coverage levels in the samples. The results are derived from depth files generated by Samtools, which quantify the number of reads aligned to each position in the genome.

## Genome Contamination
This section provides an analysis of contamination levels of exogenous DNA or non-human organisms in the samples. The results are derived from Kraken reports, which classify the taxonomic composition of the samples based on their genomic data.

### Sample: NA06994_Contamination
- **Contamination**: 0.14%

**Interpretation**: Sample quality is high.

### Sample: NA12878_Contamination
- **Contamination**: 0.25%

**Interpretation**: Sample quality is high.
